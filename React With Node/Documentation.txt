Starting Point
public/index.html
src/index.js

Actual Starting Point 
src/App.js

	var React = require('react');
	module.exports = App;
ES6
	import React from 'react';
	export App; => import { App } from './app.js'
	export default App; => import App1 from './app.js'

	create-react-app portaldemo
		react
		react-dom
		react-scripts
